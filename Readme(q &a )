2. Which are the top 10 most favorably reviewed Product IDs?

3. How may product reviews are generated on a daily, monthly and yearly basis?

4. Product sales- festival mapping. By festival mapping we are trying to analyze the top 3 Product IDs that get reviewed the most for each of the major festivals in the USA.
